# Zappos Draggable Form Application
This is a very simple application where you can drag each form on its respective column. Once you submit the form the button will become desabled => submitting it directly to the server where it will be saved on your mongoDB, check your chrome console log for the backend response.

## Steps to follow:
* Download the repo: https://github.com/e-rojas/draggable.git
